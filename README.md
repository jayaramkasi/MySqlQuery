# MySqlQuery
This is a google sheets addon which helps Query mysql from Google sheets directly.

You can deploy this as a standalone script or a bound script. As far as I can see, there is no particular difference in how you deploy to how the script runs. 

<b>How to deploy</b>

Copy the code into a google scripts project. It should have 3 files 
  - Code.gs
  - Sidebar.html
  - Connection.html

Deploy it as a sheets add on, within your domain.
